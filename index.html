<p>
  My name is Carson and I study MIS at UNO and some of my interests are learning programming, running, cooking, and
  video gaming. This webpage is dedicated to my two dogs, Mars and Juno. On this page I will share more about
  them including some photos, fun facts, and other things such as what treats they like.
